# Lots of examples have the deploy step in a separate job, but publishing artifacts for the publish
# folder took 2m 44s and 95MB, which is unnecessary when we don't need to keep it, so put deploy
# in the same job as build/test/publish

# IMPORTANT: I needed to add configuration variables on Azure for the deploy to succeed, see this issue for more
