Feature: CHARP-251
We want users and visitors to have the ability to search through and sort
remote job listings. This will entail modifying the scraper’s endpoints 
to allow people to search through the cached job listings effectively 
and easily. We also would like a more cohesive and interactive way 
for people to navigate to other pages of results (pagination).


Background:
    Given the following users exist
	  | UserName               | Email                  | FirstName  | LastName    | Password     |
	  | reynoldsa@mail.com     | reynoldsa@mail.com     | Adrian     | Reynolds    | Password123! |

    And I login
