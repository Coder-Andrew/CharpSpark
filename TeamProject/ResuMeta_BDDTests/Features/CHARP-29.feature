Feature: CHARP-29
Create a page that acts as a dashboard for all the previously saved resumes. 
Users can click these resumes and be redirected to view them.
Sprint 4 added in the ability to view cover letters to the dashboard as well.
Users can click these cover letters and be redirected to view them.
These tests are to ensure that the dashboard is functioning as expected, with those functions being:
- The current user viewing their saved Resumes
- The current user viewing their saved Cover Letters
- The current user being able to click on a Resume and be redirected to view it
- The current user being able to click on a Cover Letter and be redirected to view it
