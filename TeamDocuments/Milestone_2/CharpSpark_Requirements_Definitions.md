# Software Requirements
An individual software feature, when implemented, meets predefined functional and non-functional requirements.  A requirement itself is a need or constraint on the software to be developed.  Knowledge of all requirements leads to an understanding of the problem the software is to solve.  A primary goal is to translate requirements from the customer's language into the developer's language.

A software product or system is the product of many requirements.

## Elicitation
How can the software engineer collect requirements?  Stakeholders are identified and effective communication pathways are established; relationships between the development team and the customer are formed.

## Analysis
Perform analysis activities to detect and resolve conflicts between requirements, discover gaps and unknowns that must be determined,  find bounds and limitations and ultimately understand the requirements fully.  Must be thorough in finalizing and precise in writing requirements.

# Software Modeling and Design
Perform design activities and create models for all layers of the software architecture.  The goal is to produce blueprints for the components that make up the solution.  This phase includes analysis of the models to determine if they represent good solutions to the problem.
