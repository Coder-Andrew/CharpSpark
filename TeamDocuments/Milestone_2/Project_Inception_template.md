## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    What processes are we following?  How will we run this project? ==> Agile, Scrum, ...  
    What are we choosing to do, how will we do it and at what level of detail or extent?

## Vision Statement
    The AI-Powered Resume Enhancement Platform is a software application that enables stakeholders who already have a resume to submit their current resume, build a new resume based on recieved feedback from A.I. and industry-specific standards, as well as the capability to go back and edit their resume whenever they need to. For stakeholders who have no resume, this software application will elicit questions from the user in order to obtain enough information to build them a professional resume with ease. The purpose of this software is to enable end users the capability to produce a strong resume that will catch the attention of employers. CharpSpark is proposing this topic as each industry and position has different standards for what they look for in resumes, which can become a headache for people applying to jobs to figure out what they need to include in order to get their dream job. Not only do we recognize the difficulty to produce a strong resume, but A.I. and resume filtering softwares tend to leave applicants in the dark as to if their resume will even be looked at by human eyes. Through our proposed software, we would like to give applicants the upper hand in "defeating" these resume filtering techniques as we believe every applicant's resume should be given a chance at human review, not treated as merely another piece of data by software. <Any competitors?>
